1. Make =INVALID_OFFSET= a member of =shm_mgr=, like =npos= in =std::string=.

2. Some containers only have =emplace()= function, add a =push(const V& v)=,
   otherwise, a default constructor must be provided. Or, add a variadic
   version function =emplace(Args&& args...)= to call the constructor which
   needs some parameters.

3. =operator++= and =operator--= in iterator of =fixed_rbtree= are not
   bug-free, if the iterator points to =end()=, through =++= is meaningless,
   but =--= is meaningful, but currently this operation will not work.
