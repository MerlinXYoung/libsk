- refine all the containers, try to integrate algorithms of fixed_xxx and shm_xxx,
  just use allocators and type traits to distinguish them

- extend the =fixed_xxx= containers, let the allocator allocates memory from the
  cache first, if the memory is not enough, then allocate memory from shm

- Some containers only have =emplace()= function, add a =push(const V& v)=,
  otherwise, a default constructor must be provided. Or, add a variadic
  version function =emplace(Args&& args...)= to call the constructor which
  needs some parameters.

- =operator++= and =operator--= in iterator of =fixed_rbtree= are not bug-free,
  if the iterator points to =end()=, through =++= is meaningless, but =--= is
  meaningful, but currently this operation will not work.

- change function call =sk::shm_xxx()= to =shm_xxx()=, omit the prefix
  namespace =sk::=

- add back all missing =report()= functions in *shm* system

- remove utility/config.h

- change all =namespace sk= -> =NS_BEGIN(sk)=

- =shm_size= in config file is not needed anymore (in *server.h*)

- in *shm_timer.cpp*, the list head in =timer_vector= is allocated dynamically,
  actually we don't need this, just put them in =timer_vector=, and then get a
  =shm_ptr= from the raw pointer

- the bit count in *guid.cpp* is not reasonable, improve it, and also, the guid
  key -> value map is not needed, remove it

- all function parameters with type =shm_address/shm_ptr= should be called by
  const reference, currently they are called by value
